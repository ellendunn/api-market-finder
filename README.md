### WHAT IS MARKET FINDER
This app provides a map directory for farmers' markets local to an entered zip code,
as well as schedule, product, and direction details for particular market selected by the user. 

How to use this app: 
The user is prompted to enter a 5 digit zip code and after hitting the search button, they 
will see a map (provided by Google Maps) with pins marking all the farmers' markets local
to their given zip code. A text to the left of the map prompts the user to click on one of 
the pins to view more information about a particular market. When the user clicks on a marker,
they will see the title of the market in an info window on the map, as well as more details
about the market on the left hand side of the page. These details include a schedule of when
the market is open throughout the year, what products are regularly sold at the market, and
a link to get directions to the market from a location (to be input by the user) on Google
Maps. 
See attached screenshots for further usage.
